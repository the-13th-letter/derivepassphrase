### Added

  - The `--version` option of `derivepassphrase` and each subcommand
    additionally reports build and environment information, such as
    supported subcommands, derivation schemes, foreign configuration formats
    and active [PEPÂ 508 extras][PEP_508].  Each subcommand only reports the
    items relevant to that subcommand.

[PEP_508]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/
