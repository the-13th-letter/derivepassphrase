### Changed

  - The test suite has been cleaned up, partly reorganized, and
    rudimentarily documented.
    Several new [hypothesis][]-based tests were also added, particularly to
    test the core assumptions of the [vault][derivepassphrase.vault]
    derivation scheme about sensitivity (or lack thereof) to its inputs and
    its input formats.
