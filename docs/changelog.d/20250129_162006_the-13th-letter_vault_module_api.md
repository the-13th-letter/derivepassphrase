### Added

  - Beyond [`bytes`][] and [`bytearray`][],
    [`Vault`][derivepassphrase.vault.Vault] objects now accept arbitrary
    [Buffer][collections.abc.Buffer] objects as passphrases or service
    names.
  - [`Vault`][derivepassphrase.vault.Vault] objects now expose [the vault
    UUID][derivepassphrase.vault.Vault.UUID] and [the character
    sets][derivepassphrase.vault.Vault.CHARSETS] as public attributes.
