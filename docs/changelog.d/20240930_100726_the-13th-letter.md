### Changed

  - Rewrite functionality for checking for valid vault(1) configurations:
    include an actual validation function which throws errors upon
    encountering format violations, and which allows specifying which types
    of extensions (unknown settings, `derivepassphrase`-only settings) to
    tolerate during validation.

    This is a **breaking API change** because the function return annotation
    changed, from [`typing.TypeGuard`][] to [`typing_extensions.TypeIs`][].
    These were the originally intended semantics, but when
    `derivepassphrase` was first designed, the Python type system did not
    support this kind of partial type narrowing.
