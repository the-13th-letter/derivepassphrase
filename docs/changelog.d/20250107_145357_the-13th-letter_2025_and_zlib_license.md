### Changed

  - `derivepassphrase` changed its license from [MIT][] to [zlib/libpng][].
    This should only make a difference to people redistributing altered
    versions of `derivepassphrase`; the basic freedoms, and the
    combinability of `derivepassphrase` with other software should be
    unaffected.
